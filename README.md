# The-Chatting-App
This is my first major project in Android development.
The language I used is Java.
This app supports Android 6+.
In this project i used Firebase Realtime database to store chats and user info.
It has basic functionality of sending and receving messages.
It has phone number authentication limited to India only to implement this I used Firebase Authentication.
